**Sales Performance**

  The store's total sales reached $8,920.44M, with the highest peak occurring in 2008, when sales topped at $1,787M for that year. 

  Historically, sales have seen a gradual increase from the mid-1990s, with consistent growth into the early 2000s. This surge can be attributed to the popularity of console gaming and the introduction of several hit titles. 

  However, after 2008, the market faced a downturn, with sales decreasing by about 40% by 2012. Despite these challenges, the store managed to retain solid performance across multiple years, indicating a resilient customer base and a steady flow of new releases.
